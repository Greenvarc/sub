                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>
                    Rubella is an acute, contagious viral infection
                    . While rubella virus infection usually causes a 
                    mild fever and rash in children and adults, infection during 
                    pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, 
                    fetal death, stillbirth, or infants with congenital malformations, 
                    known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).
                    The rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets 
                    when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host.

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                    In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms 
                    including a rash, low fever "up 39°C" nausea and mild conjunctivitis. 
                    The rash, which occurs in 50–80% of cases, usually starts on the face 
                    and neck before progressing down the body, and lasts 1–3 days. Swollen 
                    lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic 
                    clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop 
                    arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3–10 days.
                    Once a person is infected, the virus spreads throughout the body 
                    in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. 
                    The most infectious period is usually 1–5 days after the appearance of the rash.

                <h2>Vaccination</h2>
                <p>
                    The rubella vaccine is a live attenuated strain, and a single dose 
                    gives more than 95% long-lasting immunity, which is similar to that 
                    induced by natural infection.
                    Rubella vaccines are available either 
                    in monovalent formulation (a vaccine directed at only one pathogen) 
                    or more commonly in combinations with other vaccines such as with vaccines 
                    against measles (MR), measles and mumps (MMR), or measles, mumps and varicella (MMRV).
